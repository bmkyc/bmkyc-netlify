        ### Lagoon Events  
        Concert in the Keys - Each summer we hire a band to serenade us on the deck of the clubhouse. All boaters are encouraged to anchor off the yacht club official sites and enjoy the music, food, friends and other yachters. Those of us who land cruise or walk, just come on down and enjoy the fun.

        ### The Commodore's Ball  
        The Commodore's Ball is held in November of each year. This is the highlight of our season and is Black Tie optional. This celebration is to thank the outgoing Board of Directors and to welcome in the new Commodore and the new Board of Directors that take office in January. This event is typically held off site at a nice restaurant or another affiliated yacht club where members enjoy great food, music and dancing.
