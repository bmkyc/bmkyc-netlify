Sailabration (BMK's version of the 4th of July) is a favorite BMK tradition and planning is well underway!

We need volunteers for a variety of roles the day of the event and in the days before.  We have supplies to get, tents to set up, and BBQ to master and all kinds of special events.   Whatever your availability and interest is, we have a spot for you!

Please contact Amy Khan at amy.ghias.khan@gmail.com. 

Tentative list of events:
- Decorated boat parade and judging 
- bike parade 
- dog parade 
- jumpy house 
- dunk tank 
- face painting 
- live music
- BBQ
